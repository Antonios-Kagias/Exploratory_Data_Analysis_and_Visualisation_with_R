# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation with R

The projects in this repository were created while working on the course Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation for my postgraduate studies. They include the following:

1. **Data wrangling**: simple data wrangling techniques and tidying the data up.
2. **Data visualization using ggplot2 library**: different data visualization approaches using two datasets.
3. **Univariate and multivariate analysis and visualisation of the Olympic Games**: correcting and cleaning the initial, problematic dataset (missing values, *None* values etc.) and then perform univariate and multivariate analysis, create interesting visualisations, make observations about the evolution of Olympic sports and world records.
